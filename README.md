Use reactive forms


Solve the problem such as 
PHP:
could not get data file_get_contents("php://input",true);

Angular
 splice(i 1) splice does not exist on type
  'paginate' could not be found
  => npm install ngx-pagination --save
 @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
 =>npm install --save @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
Not very easy but a little complexity.
